# Purpose
This repository is to assist users of Maud who encounter difficulties in 
modelling systems. Common issues will surround solutions to ODEs, convergence 
to the typical set and failure to initialise. This repository is not meant 
address issues related to Maud functionallity and they should be handled on 
the [Maud](https://github.com/biosustain/Maud) repository. 

# Structure

`debugging-tools`: A selection of tools that are useful for identifying potential model misspecification.
`initialisation`: Identifying when initialisation is an issue and how to solve the immediate initialisation 
problem.
`ode-issues`: Common ODE error flags and methods to make the system solvable.

# Standard practices

This is inteded to be a reference document for people with different levels of experience with 
ODEs and Maud. For posterities sake, including descriptors of all interactions that will make this 
repository more searchable, and therefore, more useful. E.g. sampler paused, missing rows in output 
file, etc..
